# ML Suite v1.0 Release Notes
This release is the first push of Xilinx's ML Suite to Github.  
Releasing to github will enable rapid release cycles, a smaller release footprint, and open source contribution.

### Features
* FPGA Accelerated Image Classification, support for many networks
* FPGA Accelerated Object Detection, YOLOv2 support
* Python API for deploying inference to FPGA
* Precompiled xfDNN Library
* Support for xDNNv2
* Support for VCU1525, F1


### Framework Support and Layers 
- Caffe: 1.0.0
- Tensorflow: 1.7
- Supported Layers
  - Convolution 
  - ReLU  -  supported following Convolution / Eltwise Layers
  - Pooling
  - Deconvolution
  - Concat
  - Eltwise
  - BatchNorm
  - Scale
  - Slice 
  - Layers supported in CPU:
  - InnerProduct
  - Softmax

### Known Issues
* Batch Normalization layers not supported by the quantizer
* Local Response Normalization layers not supported 
* Hardware solution for average pool causes some accuracy loss, to be fixed in a future release
* Standard ReLU is the only supported non-linearity (Leaky ReLU Networks must be modified/retrained)
